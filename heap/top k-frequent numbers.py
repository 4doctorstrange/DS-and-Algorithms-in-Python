PROBLEM: TOP-K FREQUENT NUMBER.
STATEMENT: Given an array, we have to output 'k' numbers with most frequency
APROACH: we will use MIN-HEAP and in heap we will input tuple having 2 integers, one            will be element and other will be that number's freq and sorting/placing in heap
       will be based on frequencies. We will maintain k size of heap and pop all those          tuple with less freq so that at the end we have numbers with more freqs
